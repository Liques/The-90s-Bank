## Overview

Welcome to **The 90s Bank**! This repository is dedicated to creating a vintage, DOS-style banking terminal interface. The goal is to simulate a 1990s banking system used by bankers for internal banking operations.

## Features

- **Account Balance Inquiry:** Bankers can check the balance of a customer's account.
- **Deposits:** Process deposits made by customers.
- **Transaction History:** View detailed transaction history for accounts.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to enhance my knowledge of Scala by developing a retro-styled banking system. Although the interface and functionalities are inspired by old-school DOS systems, the backend is built using modern Scala technologies.
